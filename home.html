                    This website will be the home of all my work. Personal and academic
                    projects will be showcased here with visuals and descriptions, along with the skills
                    gained and the challenges faced during the development.

                    While developing this webiste, I have learned how to link pages together, insert images,
                    change text and background color, and use JS to make my code concise. CSS is being used for
                    most of the visuals, like the image and text alterations.

                    Github is being used for version control and to make sharing code between my devices easier,
                    with the added benefit of being able to track how far I have come.
